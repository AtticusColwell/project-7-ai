# RNN Comparison Project Guide

## Project Goal
Compare three RNN architectures (Simple RNN, LSTM, and GRU) on time series prediction.

## What You Need to Do
1. Prepare the data (use provided sine wave or your own dataset)
2. Implement the three RNN models
3. Compare their performance
4. Explain why some models work better than others

## Tips
- Start early - training might take time
- Keep models similar for fair comparison

## Submit
- Your completed notebook with all cells run
- A short summary of your findings (half page)
